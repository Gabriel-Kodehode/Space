            A wasteland at the edge of human civilization. Once beyond the
            corporations' petty squabbling, now the planet and its moon has
            changed hands too many times to count. Time was a traveler might
            find a desperate kind of freedom here. Now, it's as much a prison as
            when Dahl first broke ground.

            Nexus is a scorching desert planet with vast dunes and blistering
            winds, its surface barren and desolate. Beneath the sand lies a
            hidden world: sprawling neon-lit cities, glowing with vibrant hues
            of electric blues, pinks, and greens. These underground metropolises
            thrive, powered by advanced geothermal systems. Sleek, metallic
            structures rise within massive caverns, interconnected by high-speed
            maglev trains. Neon signs and holograms illuminate the streets,
            casting a futuristic glow on the bustling nightlife. Water is
            extracted from deep aquifers, while hydroponic farms sustain the
            population. Nexus’s underground cities pulse with life, a stark
            contrast to the desolate world above.

            The planet Stonevault is a barren, rocky world, with an inhospitable
            surface scorched by its sun and lashed by violent winds. Its people
            live underground, in vast, interconnected caverns carved from the
            planet's stone layers. These subterranean cities are illuminated by
            bioluminescent plants and powered by geothermal energy. The stone
            walls provide natural insulation from the harsh surface conditions,
            and intricate tunnels connect homes, markets, and community spaces.
            Water is extracted from deep underground reservoirs, and food is
            grown in carefully managed hydroponic farms. Life below the surface
            is a blend of resourcefulness and resilience, hidden from
            Stonevault’s hostile exterior.

            Greenhell is a massive gas giant, with swirling, stormy clouds of
            deep, toxic greens, teals, and blacks, giving it an ominous, almost
            malevolent appearance. Its atmosphere is thick with poisonous gases
            like methane, ammonia, and sulfur compounds, which contribute to the
            eerie, noxious shades of green. Towering storms constantly rage
            across the planet’s surface, with lightning flashes illuminating the
            dark, swirling clouds. The storms are so intense that they span
            thousands of miles, their powerful winds and corrosive rain a
            perpetual, violent force.
